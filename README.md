# The VROOM Audio Dataset 
### VROOM stands for Various Recordings of Other Motors
Last Updated January 8, 2020

VROOM is a collection of motorized vehicle and motor tool audio recordings for use in machine learning.

This dataset is a complement to the Urban Sound Dataset https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/. In VROOM, we deliver data samples of industrial motor powered sound with more detailed labels regarding the device, craft, settings and environment.

Specifically, this dataset includes:
- Machine tooling, including class lables of power tools run at correct and incorrect settings.
- Several distinct commercial ferry boat motors from Washington State Ferry System.
- Commercial aircraft landings at LAX and SEA.  
- Miscellaneous power motor samples across power tool, aircraft and marine craft categories.

The data samples in this repo are all one second in duration with a 32000 sample rate.  
Should you want to reconstitute the original recording, the data samples are labeled by sample and sequence of each chunck.

This data repository was part of a presentation at the WiML workshop at NeurIPS 2019 in Vancouver. The poster presented at that workshop is here.  See NeurIPS poster here.  https://github.com/SingingData/Vroom/blob/master/img/Ryan-NeurIPS-poster.pdf

The goal is to add to this repository over time to enable machin elearning practitioners training models on industrial audio.  Contributions from the community are welcome.

Thanks,
Patty Ryan
